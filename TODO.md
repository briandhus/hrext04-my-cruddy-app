  ## Feature list
  * denotes on my to do for the project
  2.5 days = 20 hours

  ### difficulty scale 1-10. 1 meaning it's already finished 10 meaning what?!?!

  5 = 3 hours
  7 = 5 hours
  10 = full day + ??

  Concept: A site for creating lists. Crude wire frame in images folder

  Site will will have:
      Field for creating a category. 
      Dropdown menu for choosing a category from your previously created lists. 
      Text field for adding items to each list.
      Optional Due Date field to add to list items.
      The idea is to have lists 

  <!-- Features to add -->
  *(5) add due date / optional depending on category selected
  *(7) time stamps (moment.js)
  (5) ability to add/leave comments on item
  (4) strike-through completed/deleted items (styling)
  (3) upload files/images (display different images for different categories?)
  (2) fix the layout, input fields, change text area
  (2) Add Category text field
  (4) Add dropdown to display categories (show/hide trick)
  (2) font changes/choices? (google fonts)
  (6) notes to add to each list (maybe on the bottom of the div for a list)


  <!-- possible features to add -->
  (5) format the display of the items in a list (need to add more detail)
  (7) ability to select and delete multiple items (checkbox?)
  (5) pagination (if more than 10 show a next button)


  <!-- Not likely to add -->
  (7) color coded priority / Highlight based on status/priority/due date
  (2) highlight certain items (Outline or highlight item when clicked on)
  (3) mouse over to see details
  (10) add status/priorty and allow for sorting based on status/priority
  (10?) share item
  (10) drag and drop to arrange
  (10) search/filter on keyup/keydown
  (10) reminders? (push operation?)
  (?) secret corgi
  (5) delete item confirmation
  (1) fillet edges of boxes
  (?) Panic Button 
  () options page (ability to set/toggle options)
  () show deleted items and allow for undelete
  () add more items button, that shows another input section allowing for multiple items to be added at once
  Fun stuff
  (4) auto-complete when searching/filtering
